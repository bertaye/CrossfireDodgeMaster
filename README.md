# CrossfireDodgeMaster

I made this 2D game with Unity to learn Unity.

I used Adobe Photoshop to create my own sprites and also I use some free Assets from Unity AssetStore.
This is my first 2D Game with unity, I will made an Android version of this.

I had only one goal for this game, to make me learn Unity basics.
